# adguard-adblocker

Ad-free and malware-protection experience without hosts file.



With the hosts file, internet slow down due to cpu usage for resolve domains.
AdGuard DNS is the solution.




## Requirements:

- Magisk 19
- In this module AdGuard DNS uses port 5353, sometimes it can be blocked.
....something else?

## BUGS (for now, some of these may have been fixed):

- It does not work with some ISPs
- It blocks internet access to public Wi-Fi hotspots
- Netflix app + Chromecast compatibility issue
- Some apps use DNS Geo-location, these may not work (like Dazn, etc.)
- You can't send MMS
- And many more...

To avoid these problems you can download DNS Changer by Blockada in Google Play store... Or if you don't care, you can use this module.


## Note

- You do not need any third party application to work.
- It's the unofficial version of adguard dns.
